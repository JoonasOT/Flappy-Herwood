# Flappy-Herwood

This is just a small dumb project I created for my first university programming course.

The game is basically just my version of the popular game "Flappy bird". The project is purely for educational reasons and shouldn't interfere with anyone's IP. All pictures used are also CC0 or completely custom.

# Installation and playing

To "install", you just simply need to pull this repository and make sure you have Python 3 installed (should work with older versions too, but haven't tested it out).

To play, just run flappy.py in your favourite IDE or straight from the command line.

More detailed game instructions can be found from the beginning of flappy.py.
