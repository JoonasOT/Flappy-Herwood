# Resources
These are the images/textures and other files the game is going to depend on.

**MISSING** even of these files will result in the program returning an error.

## Game modification
To change and modify the textures the game uses, just either replace the original 
texture with a custom one (dimensions must match for the program to run as expected!) or 
replace the corresponding file path in beginning of flappy.py .
